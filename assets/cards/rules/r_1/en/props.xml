		Players sit in a circle and everyone shoud have a personal container with a (preferably alcoholic) beverage.
		
		Shuffle all the cards (except the rules) and put the pile in the middle of the circle. Players take turns taking a card off the top of the pile and must do what the card says.
		
		Cards that are played out should be collected on a discard pile.
		
		Whenever a card says to take a drink, this means 1 sip of your personal container.
