		Status cards are the yellow cards. They must be placed face up in front of the player who received it. They can be removed from play in 3 ways:
			* The cards rules mention when they should be removed from play
			* Any player takes the amount of drinks mentioned in the upper right corner
			  of the card
			* Another card is played that allows the removal of status cards
		As long as a status card is in play, its rules must be followed on every turn.
